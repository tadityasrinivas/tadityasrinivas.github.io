    <header>About Me</header>
    <article>
        Iâ€™m a Research Scientist at <a href="http://www.blippar.com">Blippar</a>, a leading Augmented Reality/Image Recognition startup, building the machine learning tech behind its visual browser. I graduated in June 2015 from Stanford with a Masters in EE. I earned my Bachelor of Technology (Honors) with a major in EE and minor in CS at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad, where I won the Gold medal.
<br> <br>
I am experienced in applying Deep Learning for Visual Recognition tasks such as fine-grained attribute recognition, human pose estimation, object detection, text recognition and for NLP tasks such as Sentiment Analysis, Named Entity Recognition and Language Modeling. Here is a link to my <a href="cv/aditya_cv.pdf">resume</a>.

            <div class="content">
		Proposed a novel architecture that uses a Recursive NN within a sentence, and a Recurrent NN over the hidden states of the Recursive NN, to process paragraphs such as movie reviews. This processing mechanism resembles the way humans read. (Tools: Python, wrote RNNs, RecNNs from scratch)
